# Causal Model Discovery Problems in Learning Joint Multiple Dynamical Systems via Non-Commutative Polynomial Optimization(NCPOP)

Welcome to the repository for data generation in causal discovery!

## We can analyz SIX types of rawdata:
1. ** Generate Data **
2. ** Learn Structure **
3. **Visualize Comparison:** Generate heat maps to compare estimated and true graphs.
4. **Calculate Metrics:** Assess the performance metrics.
5. **Demonstrate in Heatmap:** Illustrate results in a heatmap for multiple datasets.
6.
