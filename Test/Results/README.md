# Results Discription:
We collected results from Learning Joint Multiple Dynamical Systems via Non-Commutative Polynomial Optimization(NCPOP), including
* Linear_Synthetic_Heatmap.pdf
* Nonlinear_Synthetic_Heatmap.pdf

# Conclusion:
In comparison with artificial data generated from nonlinear and linear SEMs, the performances of ANM-NCPOP on linear data is better than nonlinear data. 
More precisely, the F1 score for data built on linear SEM is 0.4-0.6, but the F1 score for data built on nonlinear SEM is only 0.2-0.4.
