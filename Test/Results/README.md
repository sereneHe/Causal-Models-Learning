# Results Discription:
These are results for Learning Joint Multiple Dynamical Systems via Non-Commutative Polynomial Optimization(NCPOP). We generated nonlinear(or linear)synthetic data based on various nodes(6, 9, 12) and edges (10, 15, 20), tested F1 score for time window length between 5-35 sequentially, and demonstrated the results on a heatmap.

# Conclusion:
In comparison with artificial data generated from nonlinear and linear SEMs, the performances of ANM-NCPOP on linear data is better than nonlinear data. 
More precisely, the F1 score for data built on linear SEM is 0.4-0.6, but the F1 score for data built on nonlinear SEM is only 0.2-0.4.
