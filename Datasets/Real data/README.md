# Datasets for Causal Structure Learning

## Synthetic datasets
We provide codes for generating synthetic datasets used in '[Causal Discovery with Reinforement Learning](../research/Causal%20Discovery%20with%20RL)'. Please see the [example notebook](Synthetic_Data_Generation.ipynb) for further details.

## Real datasets
The real datasets used in [PCIC Causal Discovery Competition 2021 ](https://competition.huaweicloud.com/information/1000041487/introduction).
Please see the [example notebook](Real_Data_Standardization.ipynb) for further details.
